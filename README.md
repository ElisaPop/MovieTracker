# MovieTracker

An application for movie tracking that uses [themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API. The user can see movie details, search, bookmark movies, find on the map other people that watched a certain movie and chat with them.

## Log in/ Register

The user can log in or register using a Google account, or the traditional method: e-mail and password. This was implemented using firebase authentification.

Also, if you log out of your account, the e-mail and image link is being saved in shared preferences and auto completed on the log-in screen. When the e-mail in the field matches the saved e-mail, the image displayed changes from the default one to the personal one.
